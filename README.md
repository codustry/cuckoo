# Cuckoo

A simple IoT & FPGA based digital alarm clock

  - Internet of Things device
  - Traditional meet modern
  - Simplicity design

### Requirments
Our requirement is to create a project using 400,000 gates FPGA Xilinx’s based logic device. Project knowledge have to related to CPE224: Digital System Design class.

### Backgrounds

We want to continue our latest digital project which is digital alarm clock but we want to push it further.

We decide to made a research on human behavior and what comes out is creating a simple alarm clock that mix with well-known traditional clock “Cuckoo”. But hanging alarm clock that just beeping and set by mechanic or button is too simple for us. 

We take it further by decide that these day it is IoT (internet of things) era. We should make this clock to be set-able and control-able from the internet. So user can set time and dismiss alarm from anywhere in the world. Also, time is automatically calibrated when it’s connected to the internet.

### Concepts

From our requirements that we have to use FPGA to create gates and show time in digital we decide to add internet to the clock by using  IoT (internet of things) micro controller board called “Particle Photon”.

Particle Photon connect FPGA to the internet. Particle itself can be programmed over the internet so basically we can program FPGA over the internet.
